WORK THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE
--------------------------

Bento is a framework for creating "2D web graphics for the 21st century." It is a WebGL-first framework that is composed of various NPM modules. This means that many aspects of it can be used independently of the entire framework. Some features at a glance:

- kami
	- Modular low-level WebGL utilities for manipulating shaders, textures, FBOs, and vertex data.
	- Clean support for multiple WebGL contexts and context loss/restore
	- Highly optimized 2D sprite batcher with per-vertex color tinting
- assetloader
	- Asynchronous asset loading with custom plugins for regular and compressed textures
- cam3d
	- Camera utilities for 2D and 3D rendering
- vecmath
	- Object-oriented vector/matrix classes that [outperform gl-matrix](jsperf.com/gl-matrix-vs-vecmath)
- gl-lines
	- Line rendering utilities for WebGL

Examples:

1. Custom FBO + shader: shockwave explosion. 

2. 2D Lighting & Normal Mapping
	- Example uses thick text w/ normal map & shadows

3. Godrays




---- OTHER THINGS:

- Canvas Fallback
- Texture Atlas support
- Bitmap Fonts (canvas font -> bitmap font ?)
- Text-to-triangles and text-to-points (triangulates, etc)
- Verlet physics integration
- 3D canvas demos/tutorials




shockwave:


-- supports 3 simultaneous shockwaves
draw scene to FBO
pass the shockwave position to the shader
